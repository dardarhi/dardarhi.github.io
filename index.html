        <p> Everyone has multiple signs making up their birth chart, or as astrolgers call it, their <b> Natal Chart.</b> </p>

        <p> You can find out your Natal Chart through numerous websites that offer it. My <i> personal favorite</i> is Astro-Seek. You can find their website

    <h2> Natal Chart</h2>

    <section id="Natal Charts" class=natalstyle>
        <hr>
        <p>The "multiple signs" that make up your chart depend on where and when you were born, and how the planets were positioned at that time. </p>
        <p> All the planets ranging from the Sun to Neptune are given in the birth chart with a corresponding zodiac sign. </p>
        <hr>



        <p> This is an example of what a Natal Chart looks like. </p>

    <h2> Compatability </h2>

    <p> Some people know astrology for their compatability aspect. Some astrological signs are said to go better with each other than others. Every sign has an opposite sign, which is sometimes deemed as their best match.

    <p> Essentially, their opposite sign are very similar and very different in the sense that they make up what the other may lack.They posses every quality needed to create perfect union and completion. Of course, don't not engage in relationships with someone if you're sign isn't compatible. Astrology is vague and broad for a reason. But some other signs go better if they are in the same element. </p>

    <p> Like fire and fire (Aries and Sagiitarius) or (Geminis and Libras) both are air signs. </p>
    
    
    <section2> 
    <h2> The opposite signs of each zodiac are the following:</h2>



    <ul>
        <li> Aries- Libra</li>
        <li> Taurus- Scorpio </li>
        <li> Gemini- Sagitarius</li>
        <li> Cancer- Capricorn</li>
        <li> Aquarius- Leo</li>
        <li> Pisces- Virgo</li>
    </ul>

    <p> And the same goes for their opposites of course. </p>

</section2>


    <h2> Synastry Charts</h2>

    <p> Did you know that with the information from your Natal Chart, and your significant other, you can combine your charts 'side by side' to receive the ultimate compatbility of both of your charts. You can find these out through the above sights. On Astro-Seek they have a menu at the top displaying "Love Compatability" where you should find the calculator to determine your astrological compatability. </p>

    <p> The Synastry Chart will give you more in depth reasonings on why or why not you two are not compatible astrologically. </p>
